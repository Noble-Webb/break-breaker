Adding an old game to my repos for maintenance 

BrickBreaker Game
A Python version of the classic arcade Breakout, where you control a paddle and hit a ball against a pattern of blocks in order to destroy all of the bricks. 

It's got that great retro image play and sound that really takes you back to a better time!
